# The Carpentries at St Andrews

A GitHub home for the [Carpentries community at the University of St Andrews](https://carpentries.wp.st-andrews.ac.uk) - expect it to contain mostly repositories for workshop web pages.

Set up in mid-2023 - repositories for earlier workshops can be found under the [St Andrews Research Computing](https://github.com/StAResComp) GitHub organization.
